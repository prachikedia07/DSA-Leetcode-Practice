# üìÖ Week 7: 
## üìö Topics: Recursion & Backtracking + Sliding Window

### ‚úÖ Concepts to Study:
- **Recursion Basics**: Recursive function calls, recursion tree visualization
- **Backtracking Patterns**: Try‚Äìexplore‚Äìunchoose, pruning, base case logic
- **Sliding Window**: Fixed vs. variable window size, maintaining window data

## üîÅ Plan of Action 
  Focus on recursion basics and practice.
  Dive into backtracking patterns.  
  Push through harder backtracking problems.  
  + Introduce `Sliding Window Maximum`
