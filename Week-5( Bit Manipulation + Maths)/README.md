# ðŸ“š Week 5: Bit Manipulation + Maths

## ðŸ§  Topics to Study

- **Bitwise Operators**
- **XOR Properties** (especially for problems involving "single number")
- **Binary Representation and Manipulation**
- **Math Techniques**:
  - Excel-style column conversions
  - Hamming distance
  - Overflow-safe addition/subtraction

Take time to understand:
- How each bitwise operation affects binary numbers.
- How bit tricks help reduce space/time complexity.
- Patterns like:
  - XOR for finding unique numbers
  - Rightmost set bit usage
  - Bit count problems

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Master key **bit manipulation tricks** and understand when to apply them.
- Build strong intuition on how binary operations work under the hood.
- Recognize patterns involving:
  - XOR for unique elements
  - Bitwise counting
  - Binary digit manipulations
- Practice translating **math problems into bit operations** when appropriate.

## ðŸ›  Tips

- Use pen and paper to manually simulate bitwise operations.
- Memorize basic formulas like: `n & (n-1)` â†’ removes the rightmost set bit.
- Know `n & 1` checks odd/even, `n ^ n = 0`, `n ^ 0 = n`.
- Use unsigned types carefully in languages like C++ or Java.
- Understand why XOR works to find the unique number when all others are in pairs.
