# Week 1: Arrays & Two Pointers :

## 📚 Topics Covered
This week focuses on mastering fundamental array operations and two-pointer techniques. Key concepts include:

- Prefix Sum
- Subarrays
- In-place Updates
- Two Pointers (Start-End Window, Fast-Slow Pointer)

---

## ✅ Goals
- Build a strong foundation in array manipulation.
- Understand and apply the two-pointer approach to solve problems efficiently.
- Solve problems ranging from easy to hard on LeetCode.
