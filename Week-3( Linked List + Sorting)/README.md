# ðŸ”— Week 3: Linked List & Sorting

---

## ðŸ“š Topics to Study
- Linked List basics: node structure, traversal
- Common operations: reverse, find middle, detect cycle, addition
- Sorting Algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort logic for lists
- In-place sorting in Linked Lists

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Weekly Goal
Build strong intuition around pointer manipulation and deepen understanding of sorting logic applied in linked lists.
