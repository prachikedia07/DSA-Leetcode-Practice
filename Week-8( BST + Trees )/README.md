# Week 8: Binary Search Trees (BST) + Trees 🌳

## 🔍 Topics Covered:

* Tree Traversals: DFS (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder), BFS (Level Order)
* Recursive Tree Traversal Techniques
* Binary Search Tree (BST) Properties
* Tree Construction and Manipulation
* Binary Tree Serialization/Deserialization

---

## 📖 Concepts to Focus On:

* Recursive and Iterative Depth-First Search (DFS)
* Breadth-First Search (BFS) using Queue
* Identifying and validating Binary Search Tree (BST) properties
* Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) techniques
* Constructing trees from traversals
* Serialization and deserialization logic (Preorder-based or BFS-based)
* Recovering trees with swapped nodes (in-order logic)
