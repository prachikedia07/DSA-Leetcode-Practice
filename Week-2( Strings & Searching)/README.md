# 📚 Week 2: Strings & Searching 

## 🔍 Topics to Study
- Character arrays & basic string manipulations
- ASCII operations on characters
- Two pointers in strings
- Introduction to Binary Search

## 🎯 Goal
To strengthen understanding of string manipulation, pointer-based algorithms, and get an initial grasp of binary search applications.

## 📝 Notes & Strategy
- Begin the week by revising how C++ handles strings and character arrays.
- Pay special attention to pointer-based logic and index boundary cases.
- For binary search problems, understand how matrix can be “flattened” for 1D binary search.
- End the week with hard problems to build confidence and see how foundational concepts apply to complex questions.

## 💡 Weekly Tip
> Strings may look simple, but they’re at the heart of many real-world problems — from parsing data to pattern recognition. Mastering two-pointer and sliding window approaches will unlock many medium and hard problems faster.
