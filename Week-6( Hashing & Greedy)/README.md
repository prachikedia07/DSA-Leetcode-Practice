## üß† Key Focus

- Hashing for fast lookup.
- Greedy = best choice at each step.
- Use maps/sets smartly.
- Sort if it helps with greedy logic.

## üí° Quick Tips

- Use `unordered_map` to track frequencies and relationships.
- Sets are perfect for uniqueness and cycle checks.
- Greedy = make best local decision to move forward.
- Sort input if greedy logic depends on order.
- For 2-pass greedy (like Candy), scan forward then back.
