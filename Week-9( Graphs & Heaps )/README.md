# 📚 Week 9: Graphs & Heaps

## 📅 Topics to Cover

- **Graphs**
  - BFS (Breadth-First Search)
  - DFS (Depth-First Search)
  - Topological Sort
- **Heaps**
  - Min Heaps & Max Heaps
  - `priority_queue` in C++

---

## 🧠 Concepts to Revise

### Graphs
- Adjacency List / Matrix
- BFS & DFS templates
- Detecting cycles in directed/undirected graphs
- Topological sorting
- Connected components

### Heaps
- Min Heap / Max Heap basics
- STL `priority_queue`
- Custom comparators
- Using heap for streaming data

## 🛠️ C++ STL to Master

- `queue` and `stack`
- `priority_queue`
- `unordered_map` / `set`
- `pair` and `tuple`

---

## ✍️ Tips

- Practice both **DFS** and **BFS** approaches for graph traversal problems.
- For heap problems, be familiar with:
  - Default max-heap: `priority_queue<int>`
  - Min-heap: `priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>>`
- For topological sorting (like Course Schedule), try both **Kahn’s Algorithm (BFS)** and **DFS with cycle detection**.
- Visualize graphs to debug easier.

## 📌 Goal

Solve all 10 problems by the end of the week to strengthen my foundation in graph algorithms and heap-based problems.
