# ðŸ“š Week 4: Stack & Queue (Includes Monotonic Stack)

## ðŸ§  Topics to Study

- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Deque**
- **Monotonic Stack**
- **Valid Sequences & Spans**

Take time to understand:
- When to use stack vs queue.
- Implementation differences (array, list, deque, STL).
- How monotonic stacks help in problems involving **next greater/smaller elements**, **spans**, and **sliding windows**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Master common **stack/queue** implementations and when to use which.
- Understand how **monotonic stacks/queues** reduce time complexity.
- Recognize patterns like **"next greater/smaller element"**, **spans**, **reverse Polish**, and **backtracking with stacks**.
- Implement STL versions and also try writing them from scratch (optional but helpful).

---

## ðŸ›  Tips

- Practice visualizing stack/queue operations.
- For monotonic stack problems: maintain a strictly increasing or decreasing stack and understand why.
- For sliding window problems: use deque for efficient front and back access.
- Trace through examples with pen and paper before coding complex logic.
